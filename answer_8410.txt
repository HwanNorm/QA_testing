People generally have positive opinions about Vietnamese food, with some even calling it "yummy," "amazing," and "the healthiest food on the planet." Many also mention that they grew up eating Thai food but had a more favorable experience trying Vietnamese cuisine. Some commenters praise the variety of options available in Vietnam, including soups, dry noodles, coffee breads, spring rolls, and pancakes.

On the other hand, some people prefer Thai food, with one commenter stating that it's "better for me" or their personal favorite. However, there are also comments expressing that Vietnamese food is not as good as Thai food, such as one person saying that Vietnamese cuisine has too much spices and another person experiencing stomachaches due to the spiciness.

A few commenters mention their personal experiences with both cuisines, but some also emphasize the importance of being respectful and open-minded when comparing or discussing different cultures.
