Based on the comments, here are the commonly mentioned pros and cons of traveling to or living in Vietnam and Thailand:

**Pros of Vietnam:**

* Unique culture and experiences (e.g., "Vietnam has more large and interesting cities compared to Thailand" - @ions82)
* Less touristy and more authentic feel (e.g., "I think based on supply and demand there will be a correction that will prove less sustainable" - @SawItWithMyOwnEyes)
* Affordable prices and open people (e.g., "Vietnam is better. more open people, cheaper prices, less scams" - @giannilyanicks1718)
* Rich history and night life (e.g., "@The-Black-Robin: Vietnam felt like India. Overall Thailand is better for 'holiday' and to hook up with girls, but my travel war stories ALL came from vietnam ahaha")

**Cons of Vietnam:**

* Poverty and struggle among locals (e.g., "@The-Black-Robin: Most of the people in Saigon seemed perilously close to abject poverty")
* Limited tourist infrastructure and fewer English speakers (e.g., "@The-Black-Robin: Less tourist infrastructure. Less English")

**Pros of Thailand:**

* Well-developed tourist infrastructure and comfortable Western elements (e.g., "For western elements and comforts, I agree" - @josh.onthemove)
* Cleanliness and modern amenities (e.g., "Thailand seemed WAY cleaner" - @Sustainable_Flight)
* Safer and less scammable (e.g., "@Sustainable_Flight: In general I felt like Thailand was way scammier")

**Cons of Thailand:**

* Over-tourism and loss of authenticity (e.g., "@SawItWithMyOwnEyes: Social media influencers really upset the balance of travel and residence")
* Scams and safety issues, especially in tourist areas (e.g., "@Sustainable_Flight: In general I felt like Thailand was way scammier")
